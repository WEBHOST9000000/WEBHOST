    "introText": "One of the many reasons as to why people visit Sri Lanka is because of its very diverse wildlife. From flora to fauna, a lot of species are only endemic to Sri Lanka. A lot of people, even the locals come to nature reserves and forests to get a glimpse of rare creatures for maybe once in their whole lifetime. Alot of nature reserves and santuaries are in Sri Lanka in order to protect the wildlife from human interests that might harm the animals including poaching. Visitors are allowed in to these reserves where you can take safari trips with a trained guide provided by the reserves themselves.",

        "text": "Although a relatively small country, Sri Lanka boasts a remarkably diverse flora and fauna with many species unique to the island. This holiday will focus primarily on the resident mammals but during visits to a range of picturesque locations will additionally guarantee participants over 100 species of birds and examples of the country's colourful past at historic sites such as Sigiriya, Polonnaruwa and Kandy. We will be hoping to emulate the success of previous Naturetrek tours by finding over 20 species of mammal, with the likelihood of enhancing the total during night safaris at some locations. Among the species that present little difficulty in seeing will be Asian Elephant, Sambar, Spotted Deer, Indian Flying Fox, Toque Macaque and Purple-faced Langur, whilst we can also be reasonably confident in finding Leopard, Grey Slender Loris, Giant Flying Squirrel and Sloth Bear. The inclusion of night drives raises the possibility of locating some of the island's rare nocturnal mammals such as Rusty-spotted, Fishing and Jungle Cats or even the endangered Pangolin."

        "text": "Sri Lanka is home to 227 species of birds, 46 of which are threatened (10 critically). The national bird, Sri Lanka junglefowl, is endemic. Sri Lanka is a tropical island located close to the southern tip of India. The bird life of Sri Lanka is very rich for its size and 528 species have been recorded. In addition to the many resident birds, a considerable number of migratory species winter in the country to escape their northern breeding grounds. 34 species are confirmed as endemic, and the other resident species are also found in the nearby Indian mainland, but over 80 have developed distinct Sri Lankan races. Some of these races are very different in their plumage characteristics from the related forms in India. 26 species are globally threatened. The distribution of birds in Sri Lanka is largely determined by its climatic zones. The dry zone is the largest of the three, covering more than half of the island, with a prolonged dry and hot period and only one monsoon (the north east monsoon from October to January). The wet zone, with two monsoons, is in the south western quarter of the island, where the few remaining rain forests are found and humidity is high. The central hill zone rises to over 2450 m (8-10,000 ft) and has a cool temperate climate. Most of the 34 endemic species are confined to the wet and the hill zones, with only a few extending into the dry zone as well."

                "With its spots, long tail and lean, powerful body  there are few more impressive sights than a leopard in the wild. The Sri Lankan leopard is king of the national park and a beast many travel to Sri Lanka for just a glimpse of. But where can you see a leopard in Sri Lanka and which national park should you visit for the best chance to see the elusive big cat? Sri Lanka’s national parks are home to more than just leopards  you’ll find sloth bears, crocodiles, hundreds of bird species, wild elephants and monkeys to name just a few. We have taken a safari at most national parks in Sri Lanka.  Have we seen a leopard – yes we have. Have we seen the sloth bear yes, we’ve been fortunate enough to see that too. But we’ve also seen wonderful birds, wild elephants and at places, simply just enjoyed being in the park and the natural environment.",
                "So which is the best place to take a wildlife safari in Sri Lanka? Keep in mind – a safari in any country is all just luck. There’s no guarantee ever of a sighting (especially if you are hoping to see a leopard) and safaris take patience and are best approached with few expectations. with all that in mind, here is some information about the national parks of Sri Lanka to help you decide which is the best park to include in your Sri Lanka holiday"

The Park gets its annual rainfall during the North-East monsoons from October to January, the rest of the months being considered the dry season. The Park with its low-canopy forests, secondary forests, scrubland, grasslands, and swamps along with its proud heritage – The overwhelming Minneriya Tank that never goes dry, is considered a dry season feeding ground for Elephant populations living in the vicinity of Matale, Polonnaruwa and Trincomalee and helps sustain large herds of Elephants at most times."

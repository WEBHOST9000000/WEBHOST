In their report, the Committee urged the necessity for early selection and reservation of additional areas for the protection and preservation of the indigenous fauna and flora. Recommendations of this committee resulted in the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, No. 2 of 1937. In the subsequent times, under the legal provisions of this Ordinance, suitable areas were identified and declared as wildlife reserves. Forest Department was provided with the necessary funds to survey and demarcate these areas and to meet the payment of the watchers engaged on protective work."

Accordingly, the Wildlife Department was established in October 1949. Conservator of Forests continued as the Acting Warden, until the new Wildlife Warden, Mr. C.W. Nicolas, was appointed on the 1st of October 1950."
